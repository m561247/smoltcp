_smoltcp_ is a standalone, event-driven TCP/IP stack that is designed for bare-metal,
real-time systems. Its design goals are simplicity and robustness. Its design anti-goals
include complicated compile-time computations, such as macro or type tricks, even
at cost of performance degradation.

_smoltcp_ does not need heap allocation *at all*, is [extensively documented][docs],
and compiles on stable Rust 1.81 and later.

_smoltcp_ achieves [~Gbps of throughput](#examplesbenchmarkrs) when tested against
the Linux TCP stack in loopback mode.

## Installation

To use the _smoltcp_ library in your project, add the following to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
smoltcp = "0.10.0"
```

The default configuration assumes a hosted environment, for ease of evaluation.
You probably want to disable default features and configure them one by one:

```toml
[dependencies]
smoltcp = { version = "0.10.0", default-features = false, features = ["log"] }
```

## Feature flags

### Feature `std`

The `std` feature enables use of objects and slices owned by the networking stack through a
dependency on `std::boxed::Box` and `std::vec::Vec`.

This feature is enabled by default.

### Feature `alloc`

The `alloc` feature enables use of objects owned by the networking stack through a dependency
on collections from the `alloc` crate. This only works on nightly rustc.

This feature is disabled by default.

### Feature `log`

The `log` feature enables logging of events within the networking stack through
the [log crate][log]. Normal events (e.g. buffer level or TCP state changes) are emitted with
the TRACE log level. Exceptional events (e.g. malformed packets) are emitted with
the DEBUG log level.

[log]: https://crates.io/crates/log

This feature is enabled by default.

### Feature `defmt`

The `defmt` feature enables logging of events with the [defmt crate][defmt].

[defmt]: https://crates.io/crates/defmt

This feature is disabled by default, and cannot be used at the same time as `log`.

### Feature `verbose`

The `verbose` feature enables logging of events where the logging itself may incur very high
overhead. For example, emitting a log line every time an application reads or writes as little
as 1 octet from a socket is likely to overwhelm the application logic unless a `BufReader`
or `BufWriter` is used, which are of course not available on heap-less systems.

This feature is disabled by default.

### Features `phy-raw_socket` and `phy-tuntap_interface`

Enable `smoltcp::phy::RawSocket` and `smoltcp::phy::TunTapInterface`, respectively.

These features are enabled by default.

### Features `socket-raw`, `socket-udp`, `socket-tcp`, `socket-icmp`, `socket-dhcpv4`, `socket-dns`

Enable the corresponding socket type.

These features are enabled by default.

### Features `proto-ipv4`, `proto-ipv6` and `proto-sixlowpan`

Enable [IPv4], [IPv6] and [6LoWPAN] respectively.

[IPv4]: https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc791.txt
[IPv6]: https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8200.txt
[6LoWPAN]: https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6282.txt

## Configuration

_smoltcp_ has some configuration settings that are set at compile time, affecting sizes
and counts of buffers.

They can be set in two ways:

- Via Cargo features: enable a feature like `<name>-<value>`. `name` must be in lowercase and
use dashes instead of underscores. For example. `iface-max-addr-count-3`. Only a selection of values
is available, check `Cargo.toml` for the list.
- Via environment variables at build time: set the variable named `SMOLTCP_<value>`. For example
`SMOLTCP_IFACE_MAX_ADDR_COUNT=3 cargo build`. You can also set them in the `[env]` section of `.cargo/config.toml`.
Any value can be set, unlike with Cargo features.

Environment variables take precedence over Cargo features. If two Cargo features are enabled for the same setting
with different values, compilation fails.

### `IFACE_MAX_ADDR_COUNT`

Max amount of IP addresses that can be assigned to one interface (counting both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses). Default: 2.

### `IFACE_MAX_MULTICAST_GROUP_COUNT`

Max amount of multicast groups that can be joined by one interface. Default: 4.

### `IFACE_MAX_SIXLOWPAN_ADDRESS_CONTEXT_COUNT`

Max amount of 6LoWPAN address contexts that can be assigned to one interface. Default: 4.

### `IFACE_NEIGHBOR_CACHE_COUNT`

Amount of "IP address -> hardware address" entries the neighbor cache (also known as the "ARP cache" or the "ARP table") holds. Default: 4.

### `IFACE_MAX_ROUTE_COUNT`

Max amount of routes that can be added to one interface. Includes the default route. Includes both IPv4 and IPv6. Default: 2.

### `FRAGMENTATION_BUFFER_SIZE`

Size of the buffer used for fragmenting outgoing packets larger than the MTU. Packets larger than this setting will be dropped instead of fragmented. Default: 1500.

### `ASSEMBLER_MAX_SEGMENT_COUNT`

Maximum number of non-contiguous segments the assembler can hold. Used for both packet reassembly and TCP stream reassembly. Default: 4.

### `REASSEMBLY_BUFFER_SIZE`

Size of the buffer used for reassembling (de-fragmenting) incoming packets. If the reassembled packet is larger than this setting, it will be dropped instead of reassembled. Default: 1500.

### `REASSEMBLY_BUFFER_COUNT`

Number of reassembly buffers, i.e how many different incoming packets can be reassembled at the same time. Default: 1.

### `DNS_MAX_RESULT_COUNT`

Maximum amount of address results for a given DNS query that will be kept. For example, if this is set to 2 and the queried name has 4 `A` records, only the first 2 will be returned. Default: 1.

### `DNS_MAX_SERVER_COUNT`

Maximum amount of DNS servers that can be configured in one DNS socket. Default: 1.

### `DNS_MAX_NAME_SIZE`

Maximum length of DNS names that can be queried. Default: 255.

### IPV6_HBH_MAX_OPTIONS

The maximum amount of parsed options the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop header can hold. Default: 4.

## Hosted usage examples

_smoltcp_, being a freestanding networking stack, needs to be able to transmit and receive
raw frames. For testing purposes, we will use a regular OS, and run _smoltcp_ in
a userspace process. Only Linux is supported (right now).

On \*nix OSes, transmitting and receiving raw frames normally requires superuser privileges, but
on Linux it is possible to create a _persistent tap interface_ that can be manipulated by
a specific user:

```sh
sudo ip tuntap add name tap0 mode tap user $USER
sudo ip link set tap0 up
sudo ip addr add 192.168.69.100/24 dev tap0
sudo ip -6 addr add fe80::100/64 dev tap0
sudo ip -6 addr add fdaa::100/64 dev tap0
sudo ip -6 route add fe80::/64 dev tap0
sudo ip -6 route add fdaa::/64 dev tap0
```

It's possible to let _smoltcp_ access Internet by enabling routing for the tap interface:

```sh
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.69.0/24 -j MASQUERADE
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sudo ip6tables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s fdaa::/64 -j MASQUERADE
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1

# Some distros have a default policy of DROP. This allows the traffic.
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i tap0 -s 192.168.69.0/24 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -o tap0 -d 192.168.69.0/24 -j ACCEPT
```

### Bridged connection

Instead of the routed connection above, you may also set up a bridged (switched)
connection. This will make smoltcp speak directly to your LAN, with real ARP, etc.
It is needed to run the DHCP example.

NOTE: In this case, the examples' IP configuration must match your LAN's!

NOTE: this ONLY works with actual wired Ethernet connections. It
will NOT work on a WiFi connection.

```sh
# Replace with your wired Ethernet interface name
ETH=enp0s20f0u1u1

sudo modprobe bridge
sudo modprobe br_netfilter

sudo sysctl -w net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables=0
sudo sysctl -w net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=0
sudo sysctl -w net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=0

sudo ip tuntap add name tap0 mode tap user $USER
sudo brctl addbr br0
sudo brctl addif br0 tap0
sudo brctl addif br0 $ETH
sudo ip link set tap0 up
sudo ip link set $ETH up
sudo ip link set br0 up

# This connects your host system to the internet, so you can use it
# at the same time you run the examples.
sudo dhcpcd br0
```

To tear down:

```
sudo killall dhcpcd
sudo ip link set br0 down
sudo brctl delbr br0
```

### Fault injection

In order to demonstrate the response of _smoltcp_ to adverse network conditions, all examples
implement fault injection, available through command-line options:

  * The `--drop-chance` option randomly drops packets, with given probability in percents.
  * The `--corrupt-chance` option randomly mutates one octet in a packet, with given
    probability in percents.
  * The `--size-limit` option drops packets larger than specified size.
  * The `--tx-rate-limit` and `--rx-rate-limit` options set the amount of tokens for
    a token bucket rate limiter, in packets per bucket.
  * The `--shaping-interval` option sets the refill interval of a token bucket rate limiter,
    in milliseconds.

A good starting value for `--drop-chance` and `--corrupt-chance` is 15%. A good starting
value for `--?x-rate-limit` is 4 and `--shaping-interval` is 50 ms.

Note that packets dropped by the fault injector still get traced;
the  `rx: randomly dropping a packet` message indicates that the packet *above* it got dropped,
and the `tx: randomly dropping a packet` message indicates that the packet *below* it was.

### Packet dumps

All examples provide a `--pcap` option that writes a [libpcap] file containing a view of every
packet as it is seen by _smoltcp_.

[libpcap]: https://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/LibpcapFileFormat

### examples/tcpdump.rs

_examples/tcpdump.rs_ is a tiny clone of the _tcpdump_ utility.

Unlike the rest of the examples, it uses raw sockets, and so it can be used on regular interfaces,
e.g. `eth0` or `wlan0`, as well as the `tap0` interface we've created above.

Read its [source code](/examples/tcpdump.rs), then run it as:

```sh
cargo build --example tcpdump
sudo ./target/debug/examples/tcpdump eth0
```

### examples/httpclient.rs

_examples/httpclient.rs_ emulates a network host that can initiate HTTP requests.

The host is assigned the hardware address `02-00-00-00-00-02`, IPv4 address `192.168.69.1`, and IPv6 address `fdaa::1`.

Read its [source code](/examples/httpclient.rs), then run it as:

```sh
cargo run --example httpclient -- --tap tap0 ADDRESS URL
```

For example:

```sh
cargo run --example httpclient -- --tap tap0 93.184.216.34 http://example.org/
```

or:

```sh
cargo run --example httpclient -- --tap tap0 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946 http://example.org/
```

It connects to the given address (not a hostname) and URL, and prints any returned response data.
The TCP socket buffers are limited to 1024 bytes to make packet traces more interesting.

### examples/ping.rs

_examples/ping.rs_ implements a minimal version of the `ping` utility using raw sockets.

The host is assigned the hardware address `02-00-00-00-00-02` and IPv4 address `192.168.69.1`.

Read its [source code](/examples/ping.rs), then run it as:

```sh
cargo run --example ping -- --tap tap0 ADDRESS
```

It sends a series of 4 ICMP ECHO\_REQUEST packets to the given address at one second intervals and
prints out a status line on each valid ECHO\_RESPONSE received.

The first ECHO\_REQUEST packet is expected to be lost since arp\_cache is empty after startup;
the ECHO\_REQUEST packet is dropped and an ARP request is sent instead.

Currently, netmasks are not implemented, and so the only address this example can reach
is the other endpoint of the tap interface, `192.168.69.100`. It cannot reach itself because
packets entering a tap interface do not loop back.

### examples/server.rs

_examples/server.rs_ emulates a network host that can respond to basic requests.

The host is assigned the hardware address `02-00-00-00-00-01` and IPv4 address `192.168.69.1`.

Read its [source code](/examples/server.rs), then run it as:

```sh
cargo run --example server -- --tap tap0
```

It responds to:

  * pings (`ping 192.168.69.1`);
  * UDP packets on port 6969 (`socat stdio udp4-connect:192.168.69.1:6969 <<<"abcdefg"`),
    where it will respond with reversed chunks of the input indefinitely;
  * TCP connections on port 6969 (`socat stdio tcp4-connect:192.168.69.1:6969`),
    where it will respond "hello" to any incoming connection and immediately close it;
  * TCP connections on port 6970 (`socat stdio tcp4-connect:192.168.69.1:6970 <<<"abcdefg"`),
    where it will respond with reversed chunks of the input indefinitely.
  * TCP connections on port 6971 (`socat stdio tcp4-connect:192.168.69.1:6971 </dev/urandom`),
    which will sink data. Also, keep-alive packets (every 1 s) and a user timeout (at 2 s)
    are enabled on this port; try to trigger them using fault injection.
  * TCP connections on port 6972 (`socat stdio tcp4-connect:192.168.69.1:6972 >/dev/null`),
    which will source data.

Except for the socket on port 6971. the buffers are only 64 bytes long, for convenience
of testing resource exhaustion conditions.

### examples/client.rs

_examples/client.rs_ emulates a network host that can initiate basic requests.

The host is assigned the hardware address `02-00-00-00-00-02` and IPv4 address `192.168.69.2`.

Read its [source code](/examples/client.rs), then run it as:

```sh
cargo run --example client -- --tap tap0 ADDRESS PORT
```

It connects to the given address (not a hostname) and port (e.g. `socat stdio tcp4-listen:1234`),
and will respond with reversed chunks of the input indefinitely.

### examples/benchmark.rs

_examples/benchmark.rs_ implements a simple throughput benchmark.

Read its [source code](/examples/benchmark.rs), then run it as:

```sh
cargo run --release --example benchmark -- --tap tap0 [reader|writer]
```

It establishes a connection to itself from a different thread and reads or writes a large amount
of data in one direction.

A typical result (achieved on a Intel Core i5-13500H CPU and a Linux 6.9.9 x86_64 kernel running
on a LENOVO XiaoXinPro 14 IRH8 laptop) is as follows:

```
$ cargo run -q --release --example benchmark -- --tap tap0 reader
throughput: 3.673 Gbps
$ cargo run -q --release --example benchmark -- --tap tap0 writer
throughput: 7.905 Gbps
```

## Bare-metal usage examples

Examples that use no services from the host OS are necessarily less illustrative than examples
that do. Because of this, only one such example is provided.

### examples/loopback.rs

_examples/loopback.rs_ sets up _smoltcp_ to talk with itself via a loopback interface.
Although it does not require `std`, this example still requires the `alloc` feature to run, as well as `log`, `proto-ipv4` and `socket-tcp`.

Read its [source code](/examples/loopback.rs), then run it without `std`:

```sh
cargo run --example loopback --no-default-features --features="log proto-ipv4 socket-tcp alloc"
```

... or with `std` (in this case the features don't have to be explicitly listed):

```sh
cargo run --example loopback -- --pcap loopback.pcap
```

It opens a server and a client TCP socket, and transfers a chunk of data. You can examine
the packet exchange by opening `loopback.pcap` in [Wireshark].

If the `std` feature is enabled, it will print logs and packet dumps, and fault injection
is possible; otherwise, nothing at all will be displayed and no options are accepted.

[wireshark]: https://wireshark.org

### examples/loopback\_benchmark.rs

_examples/loopback_benchmark.rs_ is another simple throughput benchmark.

Read its [source code](/examples/loopback_benchmark.rs), then run it as:

```sh
cargo run --release --example loopback_benchmark
```

It establishes a connection to itself via a loopback interface and transfers a large amount
of data in one direction.

A typical result (achieved on a Intel Core i5-13500H CPU and a Linux 6.9.9 x86_64 kernel running
on a LENOVO XiaoXinPro 14 IRH8 laptop) is as follows:

```
$ cargo run --release --example loopback_benchmark
done in 0.558 s, bandwidth is 15.395083 Gbps
```

Note: Although the loopback interface can be used in bare-metal environments,
this benchmark _does_ rely on `std` to be able to measure the time cost.
